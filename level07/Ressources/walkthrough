##LEVEL 07

By using `strings level07`, we can see the env variable LOGNAME is called with an echo call. Which mean it display the LOGNAME.

Knowing this, we can assume we have to change the value of the LOGNAME variable in way to print the getflag.

`export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`` & `./level07` gives us the flag.
