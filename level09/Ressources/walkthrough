##LEVEL 09

Here we see that the executable is reading his first parameter, so we have to give it the token.

However we notice that its reading the parameter as a string, so we can give it the output `cat token`. We notice now that the output is different. It changes every single character by its index (char + index in ASCII table) inside the string.

We can assume we have to make a script that revert the changes made in way to get the token.

`
#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
function reversing($str) {
        for ($i = 0, $l = strlen($str); $i < $l; $i++) {
            $c = $str[$i];
            if ($c >= '0' && $c <= '9' && $i >= 1) {
                $str[$i] = $str[$i] - $i;
             }
else {
$str[$i] = chr(ord($str[$i])-$i);
}
        }
return $str;
    }
    echo reversing($argv[1]);
?>
`

Then, `php /tmp/script.php `cat token`` gives us the password f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq for flag09.
