##LEVEL 11

We can see that the `.lua` script is actually listening on 5151, so we can try to initiate the connection on it by using `nc localhost 5151`, which requires a password.

Assuming we may get the flag directly, we tried to call the command directly ``getflag > /tmp/zaza``.
It says the password is wrong, but by doing `cat /tmp/zaza`, we can see that the command has worked and we have the flag.
