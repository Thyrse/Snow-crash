##LEVEL 01

Again, looking for something to find, we can head to `/etc/` and see that the `passwd` file has different permissions.

By `cat passwd`, we can see the password for flag01 is visible. According to the previous level's file, we can assume that john is a way to decode it.

So lets use john the ripper. 

`scp -P 4242 level01@192.168.0.14:/etc/passwd .`

`./john ~/Documents/Work/passwd`

We obtain the following result : `abcdefg`

Then we can `su flag01` & type `getflag`, heading to next level.
