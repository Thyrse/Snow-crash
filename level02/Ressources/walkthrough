##LEVEL 02

Upon arrival, we can see a `.pcap` file. By looking on internet, we can see that it can be read with Wireshark.

Lets download the software and send this file into it, by listening the TCP stream and decode it to UTF-8.

Once its done, we obtain the following result -> ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L

Here, each dot equal to a deletion. So we finally have this : ft_waNDReL0L.

Now lets launch `su flag02` & `getflag` and head to the next level.
