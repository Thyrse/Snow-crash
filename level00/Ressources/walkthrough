##LEVEL 00

As its the beginning, we have to look up for something we can exploit. By going on `cd /usr/sbin` and `ls`, we may find a file named `john`.

This file contains a code that can be decoded with cesar -> `cdiiddwpgswtgt -> nottoohardhere`

Once we have this, we can assume we have to type `su flag00` and use this as a password.

This done, just type `getflag` to go to the next level.
